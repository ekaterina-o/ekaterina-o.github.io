In addition, the physiological response to low oxygen differs between Tibetans and individuals of low-altitude origin. For most individuals, acclimatization to low oxygen involves an increase in blood hemoglobin levels. However, ==in Tibetans, the increase in hemoglobin levels is limited, presumably because high hemoglobin concentrations are associated with increased blood viscosity and increased risk of cardiac events==, thus resulting in a net reduction in fitness.
