* У коренных жителей Тибета и Анд нормальный уровень **обмена веществ** для их возраста, пола и веса.
* У тибетцев немного ниже, чем у жителей Анд, уровень белка **эритропоэтина**, который регулирует производство эритроцитов (поэтому масса гемоглобина тоже меньше?)
* Оксид азота у тибетцев может не давать **сосудам легких** сжиматься при недостатке кислорода и повышает кровоток в них.
* Расширение сосудов усиливает **приток крови** к мозгу и матке во время беременности.
* У тибетцев больше **капилляров**, чем у жителей Анд, что улучшает снабжение тканей кислородом.
* По сравнению с жителями равнин у тибетцев в ногах меньше **митохондрий**, но они потребляют больше кислорода, а значит могут быть более эффективны.

# Metabolism

* Both populations have the ==normal basal metabolic rate expected for their age, sex, and body weight== (14–16), implying that their functional adaptations do not entail increased basal oxygen requirement.

# Erythropoietin

* Hemoglobin concentration is influenced by many factors, including ==erythropoietin, a protein that causes differentiation of the precursors that will become hemoglobin-containing red blood cells==.
	* ==Tibetans have slightly lower erythropoietin concentrations== than Andean highlanders at the same altitude (25).
	* When matched for volume of red blood cells, a procedure that would effectively compare the highest Tibetan and the lowest Andean values, ==Andean highlanders have much higher erythropoietin levels==, which implies that some sensor is responding as if the stress were more severe, even though the samples were collected at the same altitude of 3,700 m.

# Blood flow

* A probable reason for the ==normal pulmonary artery pressure among Tibetans is high levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) gas== synthesized in the lining of the blood vessels.
	* ==Low-altitude populations== acutely exposed to high-altitude ==down-regulate NO synthesis==, a response thought to contribute to ==hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction== (32, 33).
	* In contrast, NO is substantially elevated in the lungs of Tibetan as compared with Andean highlanders and lowlanders at sea level (Fig. 4) (34).
	* Among Tibetans, ==higher exhaled NO is associated with higher blood flow through the lungs== (30).
* Several other lines of evidence highlight the importance of high blood flow for Tibetans.
	* These include greater increase in blood flow after temporary occlusion (35) and ==higher blood flow to the brain during exercise== (36) as compared with lowlanders.
	* ==Pregnant Tibetans increase blood flow to the uterine arteries==, increase oxygen delivery to the uterus and placenta more than acutely exposed lowlanders, and give birth to heavier babies (37).

# Capillars

* A ==denser capillary network== could potentially improve perfusion and oxygen delivery, because each capillary would supply a smaller area of tissue, and ==oxygen would diffuse a shorter distance==.
	* ==Tibetans== (the study sample were Sherpas, an ethnic group that emigrated from Tibet to Nepal ≈500 years ago) who are ==born and raised at high altitude have higher capillary density in muscles as compared with Andean high-altitude natives==, Tibetans born and raised at low altitude, or lowlanders (Fig. 5) (40).

# Mitochondria

* The last potential point of adaptation is at the level of the ==mitochondrion== itself. 
	* Acutely exposed lowlanders lose mitochondria in leg muscles during the first 3 weeks at altitude.
	* Similarly, ==both Tibetan (Sherpas) and Andean high-altitude natives have a lower mitochondrial volume in leg muscle tissue== than sea-level natives at sea level (Fig. 5) (40).
	* However, Tibetans born and raised closer to sea level (at 1,200 m) also have few mitochondria, indicating that, for them, expression of ==this trait does not require exposure to high altitude==.
	* The functional implications of ==fewer mitochondria== are unclear, because overall oxygen-requiring metabolism is not lower.
	* Among Tibetans, a smaller mitochondrial volume somehow ==supports a relatively larger oxygen consumption, perhaps by higher metabolic efficiency== (12, 43, 44). [Moore_2017](2023-0922-1013.Moore_2017.md#Mitochondria)
