* Some animal studies have reported that ==bar-headed goose==, a species which migrates biannually over the Himalayas between southern and central Asia, had a ==larger proportion of oxidative fibers== in the pectoralis major muscle in comparison with that of low-altitude geese (Scott et al., 2009).
* It is noteworthy that the birds used in this study were bred and raised in captivity at low altitude, and all species had a close phylogenetic relationship.
* This indicates that the bar-headed geese have evolved and adapted their muscle phenotype to sustain ==prolonged exercise in extreme hypoxia==.
