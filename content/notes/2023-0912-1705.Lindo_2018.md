* Instead, we find differentiated SNPs in the ==DST gene, which has been linked to the proper formation of cardiac muscle in mice== (35, 41).
	* Furthermore, the DST intronic SNP that was most differentiated (rs149112613) shows histone modifications ==associated with blood and the right ventricle of the heart== (38).
	* This correlates to Andean highlanders tending to have ==enlarged right ventricles associated with moderate pulmonary hypertension== (1).
	* This finding also parallels hypotheses proposed by Crawford et al. (42) that ==Andeans may have adapted to high-altitude hypoxia via cardiovascular modifications==.
