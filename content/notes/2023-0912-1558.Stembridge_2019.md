* In contrast to Andean natives, high-altitude ==Tibetans== present with a ==lower hemoglobin concentration that correlates with reproductive success and exercise capacity==.
	* Decades of physiological and genomic research have assumed that the lower hemoglobin concentration in Himalayan natives results from a blunted erythropoietic response to hypoxia (i.e., no increase in total hemoglobin mass).
	* In contrast, herein we test the hypothesis that the ==lower hemoglobin concentration is the result of greater plasma volume, rather than an absence of increased hemoglobin production==.
* We assessed ==hemoglobin mass, plasma volume and blood volume== in lowlanders at sea level, lowlanders acclimatized to high altitude, Himalayan Sherpa, and Andean Quechua, and explored the functional relevance of volumetric hematological measures to exercise capacity.
	* ==Hemoglobin mass== was highest in Andeans, but also ==was elevated in Sherpa compared with lowlanders==.
	* ==Sherpa demonstrated a larger plasma volume than Andeans==, resulting in a comparable total blood volume ==at a lower hemoglobin concentration==.
	* Hemoglobin mass was positively related to exercise capacity in lowlanders at sea level and in Sherpa at high altitude, but not in Andean natives.
* Collectively, our findings demonstrate a unique adaptation in Sherpa that reorientates attention away from hemoglobin concentration and toward a paradigm where hemoglobin mass and plasma volume may represent phenotypes with adaptive significance at high altitude

# Hemoglobin mass

* The widespread underlying assumption has been that the lower hemoglobin concentration in Tibetans is due to an absence of ==hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis==.
	* Herein, we demonstrate this is not the case, as Sherpa have a larger hemoglobin mass than lowlanders, but a considerably larger plasma volume.
	* The result is an equivalent blood volume to Andeans but at a lower hemoglobin concentration.
	* This difference is critically important, as it means Sherpa are able to benefit from the increased oxygen carrying capacity that comes from an ==expansion of their hemoglobin mass, but are not restricted by an increase in blood viscosity that hinders microcirculatory blood flow== (8).
